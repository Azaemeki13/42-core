1 - How does a VMachine works ?
    A VM is a reproduction of a computer's given hardware using
    a technology called virtualisation. In this process there
    are two parties. The host and the guest , host is physical 
    , guest is virtual.
    A software called Hypervisor is responsible for allocating
    ressources from the host to guest. 

2 - Why Debian ?
    Debian is a Linux distribution, meaning I also have Linux 
    Kernel advantages (portative, open source, security etc..)
    It's also easy to take in hand when new to admin software.
    Concerning hardware, it supports lots of CPU architectures.
    That's important as if you have an OS that only supports
    one type of instruction, it makes you dependant of one fur-
    nisher.

3 - What's the difference between Rocky and Debian ? 
    Debian has good documentation, easier to take in hand
    Rocky on other hand has extra security and is designed
    to work 100% bug free with cloud solution RedHat.

4 - What's the difference between Aptitude and APT ? 
    Aptitude is a higher level package manager, includes
    fancy functionalities like GUI, resolution proposals
    displayal of changelogs. 
    That's because aptitude isn't native to Debian, and 
    needs to be installed with APT, while APT comes from 
    the default package.

5 - What's AppArmor ? 
    It's a kernel security module that is used to protect
    the system. Using profiles, it can control the res-
    sources used by apps using different profiles that are 
    restricted with Mandatory Access Control. 
    That means each user has clearance level that allows
    the latter to have mroe or less ressources.

6 - A / D of a strong password policy ? 
    D : - You can forget it, people may not remember them
    or be tempted to switch to simpler ones.
    A : - We're avoiding easy password, making it hard to 
    bruteforce the way in. Plus 30 days policy, no PW like
    the previous one makes it easier to prevent social 
    engineering breaches.

7 - What can you say about implementation ? 
    To verify this, we can look for pam.d password quality 
    it should be located in /etc/pam.d it's quite easy to 
    implement actually, just arguments.

8 - What's a Partition ? How does LVM works ? 
    You could call a partition when a part of a hard drive
    is formatted to welcome data in an ordered way.
    Partition usually have names C: D: on Windows , sda 
    on Linux. 
    LVM is a software to install on Linux systems that allows
    users to easily format and create partitions.
    In it you can split a physical volume (hard drive)
    into volume groups that are composed of logical 
    volumes. 
    It helps working on different disks having different 
    physical sources.

9 - What's sudo ? 
    Remember before when we talked about MAC ? 
    Sudo uses the same princip. 
    It's a user with elevated privileges. Requires a sudo
    password, or a user that's put in sudoers group.
    Sudo is like an admin on windows, it can install delete
    and access system files. You can have it temporarly 
    or permanently on a shell. 
    You can find the list of sudo-ers in /etc/sudoers.
    You can also find more in sudo.conf.

10 - What's UFW ? 
    UFW, UncomplicatedFireWall is a software that help a 
    user in managing its firewell. A firewall is a manager
    that is responsible for allowing who can connect where.
    That is very usefull as it can control who accesses which
    part of the server. 

11 - What's an SSH ? 
    SSH or Secure Shell, is a communication protocol. 
    It encrypts an information that is shared between two
    parties.
    Both parties (server and client) exchanges public keys
    and use private keys to decipher the message. This way
    unless having both keys, it is almost impossible to read 
    the sent message. 

12 - What is cron ? 
    Cron, derivated from Chronos greek titan of the time, is 
    an automation software that can perform tasks automatically
    on your computer given time and action arguments.
    It is for instance used here to launch a script every
    10 minutes.
